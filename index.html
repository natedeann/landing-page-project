            <p>I walked into The Eight Art with more doubt than muscle — two left feet and a head full of excuses.<br>
             Six months later I moved with purpose, landed strikes I never dreamed I could, and learned how to turn fear into fuel.<br>
              This place didn’t just teach me technique — it taught me who I could be when I stopped holding back.”<br>
